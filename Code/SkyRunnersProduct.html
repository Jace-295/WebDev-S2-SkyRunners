                    if not then next delivery is to be expected. Simply leave the item on

                    This service is for when you want to send a more...unorthodox message.
                    We will take the specified item (items that are specifically more questionable)
                    and deliver them to the intended recipients address. The final delivery location
                    however, can be set by you. Whether that be under the sheets Godfather style or
                    in draws or cupboards.

                    This service is more of a prank than actual delivery service. 
                    We will take a desired item and place it in a specified 
                    location in the recipients address.when the recipient removes 
                    the item, we will place an identical item somewhere
                    else within the address. We will continue to do so for 20 days.
